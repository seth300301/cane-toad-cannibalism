# Cane Toad Cannibalism Netlogo Simulation
### Authors: Seth Ng and Yi Zhou

## Main Responsibilities
Cane Toad Cannibalism Netlogo Simulation:
- Developed a complex simulation model based on the cannibalism that occurs within cane toad populations.
- Implemented real life processes from the population through design reviews and problem identification.
- Documented processes and concepts using Overview, Design Concepts, and Details (ODD) descriptions.
- Conducted and recorded suitable methodologies to test and compare results of different simulation scenarios.

## Summary
Cane toads are infamously known in Australia for their negative impact on the environment by disrupting the ecosystem and wildlife through their toxins that prevent them from being preyed upon and their capability to lay thousands of eggs in a batch. This project showcases a relatively complex Netlogo simulation regarding the cane toad population and focuses on the bizzare phenomenon of cannibalism that occurs within their species in Australia. The simulation considers many real life processes that occur within the cane toad population such as:

- Movement
- Growth
- Death
- Reproduction
- Detection of Food and Eating (Food Source or Another Smaller Cane Toad)
